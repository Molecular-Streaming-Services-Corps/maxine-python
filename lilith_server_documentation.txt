This is Jade's documentation for the Lilith server side.

Lilith has logs. Could be useful. If you can find them...

Reading websocketdata.cpp
    void WebSocketInfo::message
Processes all sorts of messages on the server. Maybe the start button is necessary?

Sends packets to a DemonController object which interfaces with the Teensy somehow. (Over the LAN?)

The code in Lilith that receives a request_data message also sends some data. Same with the code for get_metadata. There's no explanation why we're not receiving messages.
