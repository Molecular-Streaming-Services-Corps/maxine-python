This is Jade's documentation for the Lilith server side.

Lilith has logs. On stderr

Reading websocketdata.cpp
    void WebSocketInfo::message
Processes all sorts of messages on the server. Maybe the start button is necessary?

Sends packets to a DemonController object which interfaces with the Teensy somehow. (Over the LAN?)

The code in Lilith that receives a request_data message also sends some data. Same with the code for get_metadata. Make sure to send binary data in big-endian or everything will break!

The START message changes the (sample) rate but nothing else. You change the bias with TYPE_BIAS
Message: WEBSOCK_START_BUTTON (10), uint16 device (0), float rate # HHf
Message: TYPE_BIAS (2), uint16 device (0), float bias_voltage in Volts #HHf
How do you move the syringe? I don't think you can.
